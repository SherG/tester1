I started training him with a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_training" target="blank">High Intensity Training (HIT)</a> approach. 

Then for several years we used an offshoot of HIT called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Slow" target="blank">SuperSlow</a>.

Over the last few years I noticed that despite having built considerable strength and stamina with those two protocols, Fernand was starting to experience some challenges with balance.

## Improving Balance

The act of balancing oneâ€™s bodyweight and a barbell with resistance can help clients like Fernand develop and improve their balance. 

This helps with mobility and protects against the likelihood of falling.  

So I coached Fernand on various barbell movements like the squat, press, deadlift and bench press.

## Celebrating a Friendship

Yesterday marked 25 years that I've had the privilege of coaching Fernand. Over the course of those years I'm even more proud to call him a friend.

Thank you dear Fernand for granting me the trust to guide you this past quarter century. You are my inspiration and my purpose!

## An Invitation For You

If you're interested in exploring what strength training can do for your health and well-being, I invite you to book a <a href="https://calendly.com/isfny/15min" target="blank">phone appointment</a> with me, Francisco Villalobos, owner of Inner Strength Fitness in Manhattan. 

There's no other topic that I enjoy discussing more. After all, our strength and health is the foundation for a well-lived life.
