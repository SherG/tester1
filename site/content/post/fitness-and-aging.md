  I’ve been an athlete all of my life, albeit never an excellent one.  I did
  well as a sprinter in high school, I was good enough at tennis to be invited
  to play doubles for U.C. Berkeley and I’ve been practicing some martial or
  other since I was 6.

As a martial artist I’ve one my share of trophies and belts in full-contact karate, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, submission gaping and Mixed Martial Arts competition, the latter in which I competed professionally for about six years while in my mid- to late thirties.  

But I was never at the level of Olympic athletes or UFC fighters.  

## Athletic Memories

Nevertheless, I can’t help but feel a sense of sadness when I read A.E. Houseman’s “To An Athlete Dying Young”.  

It’s an elegy to anyone who has competed in some any form of athletics to which they have devoted their heart, sinews and countless hours.  

Unlike the athlete of that poem, I have lived long enough to regard those athletic achievements of yesteryear wistfully.

## Continue Striving

But just as Houseman’s poem serves as a reminder of those precious athletic memories and of how much my aging body disappoints me daily, Dylan Thomas’ poem, “Do not go gentle into that good night” reminds me to continue striving for whatever level of excellence is still open to me. 

In this video below, I’m using paused deadlifts to help me recover from my second back surgery last fall. 

The Olympic Committee or the UFC will never come a calling, but I cannot give up on my quest to continue working on my strength in the gym and practicing my skills in the dojo. 

I’m an Athlete of Aging now and my arena is Life. My victory will be living out the rest of my years fully, ever striving, never quitting!
