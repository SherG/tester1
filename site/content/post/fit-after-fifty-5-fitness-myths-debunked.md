  Like you, I'm a baby boomer. We want to thrive in the coming decades, and that
  means committing to the most effective and efficient physical fitness program.
  But how can we know what is best for us?

Here I debunk 5 common fitness myths and provide critical answers.

## Myth #1: Aerobic Exercise is the Best Way to Become Fit

Have you ever engaged in “aerobic” or what I prefer to call steady state exercise?  

If so, ask yourself the following:

1. How much time did you spend doing these exercises per week? 
2. How long have you been working on transforming your body through “cardio” classes, running, jogging or sports related activities? 
3. Are you pleased with the results?
4. If not, what motivates you to continue engaging in these steady state exercises?  
5. What would you say, dear reader, if I told you that steady state exercise is not the best way to physically transform yourself?

### Is Aerobic Exercise the Best Way to Lose Weight?

Most people who exercise do so to lose fat, i.e., to look better. They may believe that exercise helps them burn a great number of calories but they are mistaken.

Exercise, especially moderate to low intensity endurance activities like jogging, walking, or riding a bike burns few calories. Given that there are 3,500 calories in a pound of fat, most of you would have to run for 14 hours at a moderate pace to lose one pound of fat. Even if you divide that commitment over six days, that would be over two hours of running each day. How many of us have that much free time to waste?  

Aside from the time investment required, how many of us would be willing to bear the risk of repetitive stress injuries to your knees, shins, feet and hips. And this is assuming you don’t have to run through a bad neighborhood and run the added risk of getting mugged. Then again, the threat of getting mugged might make you run faster and burn more calories!  I’ll let you ponder whether that would be a good trade off.

### Aerobic vs. Anaerobic:  Debunking Misconceptions

The aerobic pathway of energy production, which uses oxygen to produce energy, is not separate from the anaerobic pathway of energy production. 

You can refer to any standard physiology textbook to verify the truth of this. This is why I prefer to place the word “aerobic” or “cardio” in scare quotes. 

Therefore, the maxim offered in the old Susan Powter infomercials to the effect that we need to “move in oxygen” is vacuous. We always use oxygen for energy, no matter how intensely we are exerting ourselves.

### Recreation and Social Benefits

The foregoing should not be taken as a disparagement of steady state exercise or sports related activity. These activities, which we can collectively label as "recreational," can be fun to engage in and some, like sports and exercise classes, have a social element to them that can serve as an important value

### The Limits of Aerobic Workouts

Some sorts of recreation can have a greater exercise effect then others because of the demands those activities impose on the body’s musculature. Wrestling is definitely more demanding than golf and sprinting is likewise more demanding than a casual jog.

But although recreational activities like these may be fun and have varying levels of exercise effect, they are not an effective form of exercise for fundamentally transforming one’s body and physical health for the better.

### The Importance of Strength and Resistance Training

The most fundamental physiological adaptation one can derive from exercise is strength — the capacity to express force against an external resistance. The reason for this is that, evolutionarily speaking, our capacity for locomotion (movement) is second only to our capacity to reason in importance in terms of insuring our survival and flourishing. And only intelligently planned resistance training of the major muscles can bring about that adaptation.

### Why is Resistance Training So Important?

When you engage in resistance training, the muscles you are exercising, along with the connective tissue and bones that affect movement, are challenged. When this happens, the muscles send a message to the brain, letting it know that continued locomotion is threatened.

The brain interprets this data as a threat to survival and it responds by issuing commands that would make it possible for the whole of you—your musculoskeletal and cardiovascular system together -- to surmount the current challenge should it ever present itself again.

The brain might order an improvement in the neural communication between it and your muscles. This is normally what happens during the early stages of your strength training, or when you perform an exercise or movement your body is unaccustomed to. The sum effect of these neurological adaptations is that the muscles become stronger without becoming larger.

But these neurological improvements can only drive strength adaptations so far. After a certain point, the brain may order that new muscle be made and that is a process call hypertrophy.

Just as the tensile strength of a rope or cable increases in proportion to increases in its cross sectional area so to does the strength of a muscle increase as it grows larger, through an increase in the cross sectional area of its fibers.

### How Does Resistance Training Work?

The foregoing adaptations caused by resistance exercise follow what is called the S.A.I.D. principle, short for Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands. 

Only certain demands on the body will elicit certain responses. Moderate exposure to the sun will create a tan, but too much sun will create sunburn.

The stress of exercise must be challenging enough to get the body to adapt, either neurologically or by making the muscles larger. This can be achieved only if the brain perceives the demands of the exercise to be such that they threaten the individual’s capacity to move and hence his survival.
