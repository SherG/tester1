  Like you, I'm a baby boomer. We want to thrive in the coming decades, and that
  means committing to the most effective and efficient physical fitness program.
  But how can we know what is best for us?

Here I debunk 5 common fitness myths and provide critical answers.

## Myth #1: Aerobic Exercise is the Best Way to Become Fit

Have you ever engaged in “aerobic” or what I prefer to call steady state exercise?  

If so, ask yourself the following:

1. How much time did you spend doing these exercises per week? 
2. How long have you been working on transforming your body through “cardio” classes, running, jogging or sports related activities? 
3. Are you pleased with the results?
4. If not, what motivates you to continue engaging in these steady state exercises?  
5. What would you say, dear reader, if I told you that steady state exercise is not the best way to physically transform yourself?

### Is Aerobic Exercise the Best Way to Lose Weight?

Most people who exercise do so to lose fat, i.e., to look better. They may believe that exercise helps them burn a great number of calories but they are mistaken.

Exercise, especially moderate to low intensity endurance activities like jogging, walking, or riding a bike burns few calories. Given that there are 3,500 calories in a pound of fat, most of you would have to run for 14 hours at a moderate pace to lose one pound of fat. Even if you divide that commitment over six days, that would be over two hours of running each day. How many of us have that much free time to waste?  

Aside from the time investment required, how many of us would be willing to bear the risk of repetitive stress injuries to your knees, shins, feet and hips. And this is assuming you don’t have to run through a bad neighborhood and run the added risk of getting mugged. Then again, the threat of getting mugged might make you run faster and burn more calories!  I’ll let you ponder whether that would be a good trade off.
