description: The first week of a fat loss diet is always the most motivating
---
The 1st week of my 2019 fat loss journey is in the books.  As I expected based on past experience and experience with clients, the first week saw larger then average weight loss due to water loss.  

Despite measuring everything before I put it in my mouth, even on the weekend, I can assure you that I did not violate the First Law of Thermodynamics.  There is no way I lost 4.4 lbs. fat in one week.  So some of that weight loss must have been water loss as my sodium levels go from vacation to diet levels.  

Nevertheless, there is no week as positively reinforcing as the first week.  Every subsequent week from here on out will require me to be more patient and clear minded about my goal.

As uneventful as weekly results may be, especially after the first week, I thought it important to share my process.  It’s easy to be motivated by what we imagine will be the end result as well as by the dramatic degree of change at the outset.

But I don’t think it would be as instructive to my dear readers to see a before and after picture and measurements spaced weeks or months apart.

I want to share the grind of the journey—the part that tests my patience and resolve. 

 I want to share the setbacks, the tactics I employ to deal with these as well as the euphoria that comes from seeing  the goal coming closer to attainment.

Stay tuned!

My specs after week 1:

* Lost 4.4 lbs.
