> “We are what we repeatedly do.”

\-Will Durant explaining Aristotle’s view of virtue.



Every day presents us with numerous choices that impact our health.  Couch or gym.  Empty my plate or set aside leftovers when I’m satisfied.  Have a drink to toast a moment or get wasted.  These innumerable choices make up our lifestyle and direct us towards greater vitality or greater morbidity.



The choices have always been and can only be yours to make.  There are no shortcuts to a healthful state.  Choose to thrive!
