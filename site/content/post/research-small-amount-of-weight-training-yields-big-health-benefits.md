  New research reveals that even a small amount of weight lifting (resistance
  exercise) yields dramatic health benefits.

In December of last year, the _New York Times_ reported on a study that "provides evidence for the first time that even a little weight training might reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke."

The study compared exercise habits of over 12,000 people with risk of heart attack, stroke or death. 



> "People who lifted twice a week, for about an hour or so in total, had the greatest declines in risk." 

The _Times_ explains: 

<p style="margin-left: 40px">**The findings were dramatic**: The risk of experiencing these events was roughly 50 percent lower for those who lifted weights occasionally, compared with those who never did â€” even when they were not doing the recommended endurance exercise. </p>

Those who enjoyed the greatest decline in risk: 

* Lifted twice a week
* Spent about an hour in each weight lifting session

The study that the Times is referencing was published in October in the journal [_Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise_](http://www.ovid.com/site/catalog/journals/586.jsp). The study used a large store of health data from the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, Texas.

## Cardiovascular Benefits

The Times acknowledged that popular thinking is that resistance training doesn't offer the cardio benefits of aerobic training. 

This is the sort of thinking that I've dedicated my professional career to overturning. 

The research showed that these health benefits accrued _regardless of whether the participants engaged in frequent aerobic exercise_.  

Readers of this blog, or clients of ISF will not be surprised by these findings. The principles behind our strength training are backed by a significant amount of research.

## Short Exercise Sessions Do Work

The most common excuse given for not exercising is lack of time.  Worry not, dear reader!  This new research provides hope to the harried.
