  I'm in week 2 of my 2019 Fat Loss Transformation challenge. What are my
  results?
---
As expected, the rate of weight loss and the reduction in the circumference measurements I took slowed down.

Whereas I lost a total of 4.4 lbs. of total weight after week 1, I lost just 2.5 lbs. after week 2.  

## Water Loss

My body passed the stage of letting go of a lot of water after I started the diet and began regulating my sodium intake and settled into a water balance that is a new normal.

Speaking of water balance, a lot of people who are eating with the goal of losing fat get discouraged when they see the scale go up occasionally during the week.  

Some may even be tempted to give up on their goal when they experience that happen.  

But because of variations in body water from day to day due to daily variations in how much you sweat during a workout or how much water you drink, total weight on the scale can vary considerably from day to day.  

## Stay Encouraged! 

Don’t be discouraged! This is entirely normal. Just weigh yourself every day right after waking and voiding. 

Take the average of all the days you weigh and compare that average from week to week. Focus on lowering that average, regardless of what your scale says any given morning.

Progress in my circumference measurements also slowed. Whereas I lost a total of 3 inches from the sum of all circumference measurements taken after my first week, after the second week I lost a respectable 2.5 inches total.  

## Losing An Inch Off My Waist

I am happy that one whole inch of that total came off my waist—the target of my fat loss efforts.  

As buoyed as I am by my results thus far I’m a little disheartened that I don’t see much of a difference in my pictures. 

I’ve made a point of keeping the lighting, the distance of the camera, background, clothing and poses the same.

I can’t stand it when supplement companies post a before and after transformation picture in which the person is sticking their gut out under harsh lighting in the before pic only to appear well tanned, flatteringly angled and professionally lit so as to accentuate their fat loss transformation in the after pic. 

 But if you using pictures to offer objective evidence of the fat loss process, as I’m striving to do with my journey, you have to accept that the visible changes from week to week won’t be that dramatic.

Till next week dear readers!
