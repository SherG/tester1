The study is covered in this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/well/move/even-a-little-weight-training-may-cut-the-risk-of-heart-attack-and-stroke.html" target="blank">_New York Times_</a> article.

## A 50% Decline in Risk of Heart Attack or Stroke

Reporter Gretchen Reynolds wrote: "The findings were dramatic: The risk of experiencing these events was roughly 50 percent lower for those who lifted weights occasionally, compared with those who never did â€” even when they were not doing the recommended endurance exercise."

She added, <mark>"**People who lifted twice a week, for about an hour or so in total, had the greatest declines in risk**</mark>."

Even better, these health benefits accrued regardless of whether the participants engaged in frequent aerobic exercise.
