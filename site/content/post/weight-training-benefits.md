The most common excuse given for not exercising is lack of time.  Worry not, dear reader!  A recent [_New York Times_ article](https://nyti.ms/2DZQsRh) provides hope to the time compressed.  

The study found that even a small amount of weight training could reduce your risk of heart attack or stroke.  

The article is based on a study published in October in the journal [_Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise_](https://greysteel.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=45469f474a28b6a3c8167df48&id=311b2ae563&e=44cb3a58d3)_._ 

## A 50% Decline in Risk of Heart Attack or Stroke

Times report Gretchen Reynolds wrote: "The findings were dramatic: The risk of experiencing these events was roughly 50 percent lower for those who lifted weights occasionally, compared with those who never did — even when they were not doing the recommended endurance exercise."

She added, <mark>"**People who lifted twice a week, for about an hour or so in total, had the greatest declines in risk**</mark>."

Even better, these health benefits accrued regardless of whether the participants engaged in frequent aerobic exercise. \

So what’s your excuse now?
