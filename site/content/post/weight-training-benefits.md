The most common excuse given for not exercising is lack of time.  Worry not, dear reader!  A recent _New York Times_ article provides hope to the time compressed.

Even better, these health benefits accrued regardless of whether the participants engaged in frequent aerobic exercise. So whatâ€™s your excuse now?
