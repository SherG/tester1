  My client Fernand, now in his 80s, trains exclusively with barbells. He looks
  great and feels stronger than ever.

I started training him with a basic High Intensity Training (HIT) approach and then we used an offshoot of HIT, Superslow, for several years.  

Over the last few years I noticed that despite having built considerable strength and stamina with those two protocols, Fernand was starting to find maintaining balance in certain situations a greater challenge.  

The act of balancing oneâ€™s bodyweight and a barbell with resistance can help clients like Fernand develop and improve their balance. This helps with mobility and protects against the likelihood of falling.  

So I coached Fernand on various barbell movements like the squat, press, deadlift and bench press.

Yesterday marked 25 years that I've had the privilege of coaching Fernand. Over the course of those years I'm even more proud to call him a friend.

Thank you dear Fernand for granting me the trust to guide you this past quarter century. You are my inspiration and my purpose!
