I started training him with a basic High Intensity Training (HIT) approach. Then for several years we used an offshoot of HIT called Superslow.

Over the last few years I noticed that despite having built considerable strength and stamina with those two protocols, Fernand was starting to experience some challenges with balance.

## Improving Your Balance

The act of balancing oneâ€™s bodyweight and a barbell with resistance can help clients like Fernand develop and improve their balance. 

This helps with mobility and protects against the likelihood of falling.  

So I coached Fernand on various barbell movements like the squat, press, deadlift and bench press.

## Celebrating a Friendship

Yesterday marked 25 years that I've had the privilege of coaching Fernand. Over the course of those years I'm even more proud to call him a friend.

Thank you dear Fernand for granting me the trust to guide you this past quarter century. You are my inspiration and my purpose!
