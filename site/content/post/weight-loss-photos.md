Look at the amazing transformation below. 

How long do you think it took this beautiful young lady to transform her body? How many hours do you think she invested at the gym to sculpt these results? What diet secrets underlie her magical metamorphosis?

More importantly ask yourself the following questions: What would you do for results like this? 

* Would you starve yourself? 
* Would you eat nothing but kale and freshly squeezed, organic raisin juice? 
* Would you pay a fortune to a personal trainer if he had before and after pics like these attached to client testimonials?

\
The courageous personal trainer pictured above took these pictures of herself on the same day, moments apart, to prove a point: before/after photos, unless professionally and objectively standardized, are, at best, misleading. 

Moreover, as she points out in her blog, they are not informative. \
\
In most cases, before/after photographic comparisons donâ€™t tell you exactly how the person made the transformation, but often tout the latest "amazing" supplement.
