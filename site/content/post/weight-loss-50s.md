I attained my goal of a 35” waist this morning. From January 6, that is 2.75” off of my waist, 8.75” and 12.6 lbs. lost overall.  

It took me a little less then 6 weeks and with the exception of two days visiting my father last weekend, meticulous accounting of everything I put in my mouth using the <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/" target="blank">MyFitnessPal app</a>.

I started off doing martial arts class and weight training 3 times a week. But over the last two weeks I had to pair down to twice a week (for each) to avoid feeling too run down by the caloric deficit.  

When I tried on my suits this morning, feeling comfortable in my slacks made the whole process worth it.

So even if you are in your fifties like me, if you find yourself fluffier then you like or pushing into your belt line more then is comfortable, you can definitely become leaner. 

It will require honesty, integrity, courage and consistency but feeling more comfortable in your body makes the investment of these virtues worthwhile!
