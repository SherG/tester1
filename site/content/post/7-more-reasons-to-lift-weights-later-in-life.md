We need resistance training later in life. Period.

That means lifting weights – or using resistance bands or body weight – to grow and maintain muscle mass.

Why? Not to look like a bodybuilder. (That’s super-hard and takes a long, long time.) It’s merely the fact that human beings lose muscle mass as we age, and being strong is key to healthy aging.

There are so many reasons why it’s not just good for us after 50, but essential. We’ve written about this before, and we could talk about it all day. Sometimes, we do! It’s that important.

Here are seven more of the countless reasons why “older” people should be lifting weights.

1. It is good for cardiovascular health. Resistance training lowers blood pressure, bad cholesterol and inflammation.
2. Resistance training relieves anxiety and tension.
3. It helps improve our self-esteem and keeps us from thinking we’re weak.
4. It can improve memory and mild cognitive impairment.
5. Strength training is effective at treating the symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. It reduces fasting glucose levels and improves overall glycemic control.
6. Weightlifting helps us recover from hip fractures.	
7. It boosts our metabolism, in addition to burning fat and building muscle. So we’re also using more calories when we’re resting and sleeping.

Still not convinced? Come see us, and we’ll give you seven more. At least.
