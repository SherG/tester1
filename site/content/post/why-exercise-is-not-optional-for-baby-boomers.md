  I would like to start where most who write about exercise for popular
  magazines will not start — with a discussion of our genetic limitations.

The best place to start this discussion is with the recent discovery of the myostatin deletion and the Belgian Blues.

## What We Can Learn About Exercise From Belgian Blue Cattle

Often, advances in one science come from discoveries made in other fields.  So it is in this case that involves the discovery of a key genetic factor influencing muscular potential. 

Scientists in agriculture have discovered a genetic factor which has profound implications for the field of exercise science.  This is the story of the Belgian Blue cows.

Due this genetic factor, Belgian Blues lack a protein that regulates muscular growth.  This mutation is called “double muscling” and it causes the cows to look like the bovine equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

### The Relationship Between Muscle Development and Genetics

What is even more interesting for the purposes of this article is that a similar myostatin deletion has been discovered in Flex Wheeler, and other  top-ranked professional bodybuilders. Anyone with eyes could see that genetics plays a role in how they look.

Now we have concrete evidence of at least one genetic factor involved in how muscular (and lean) some of us have the potential to become. 

When we see the words “results may vary” in muscle magazine supplement ads, we can now understand what a colossal understatement that is!

Many may take this to be a cause for depression or an excuse for inactivity.  After all, if becoming muscular and lean is in our genes, what could we do? Should we bother to exercise at all?  

My answer is a resounding yes! Later in this article I will go into the reasons why you should.

For now let me point out how flawed this thinking is by reference to a conversation I once had with a friend and colleague.  My friend and I argued about the implications of the fact that genetics plays a large role in determining an individual’s intellectual capacity or I.Q.  

My point was that even if one accepts that genetics imposes definite limitations on what we are capable of intellectually, as we attempt to maximize our unknown potential throughout our lifetimes, we don’t know what those boundaries are, except in hindsight. 

Within the boundaries imposed by the facts of our genetic reality there is freedom: freedom for us to strive to be our best and that makes all the difference.  

That said, I’m not an existentialist.  I don’t equate freedom with total freedom from the constraints of reality -- freedom to recreate ourselves independent and in defiance of the facts of reality.  

I agree, with Francis Bacon that “nature to be commanded must be obeyed.”  Just as we can emphasize the importance of volitionally adhering to the facts of reality, so we can emphasize that doing so gives us great freedom and power in commanding nature.  So it is with our nature, whether it be our physical nature or our spiritual nature, our consciousness.

## Becoming Strong: It's More Than Just a Physical Transformation

In this article I will focus on the imperative to alter our physical selves, specifically by making ourselves stronger.  

The transformation made possible by becoming stronger is not merely physical.

Becoming stronger is about projecting how we feel about ourselves — projecting the heroic sense of life within each of us through the shape and functional capabilities of our bodies.  

Applying the knowledge and discipline it takes to exercise correctly is about externalizing our spiritual selves — it's about projecting our ideals outward.

### Beware of Fitness Fairy Tales and Bias

Fitness magazines are trying to sell you a dream  — the dream of a well-muscled, chiseled physique via supplementation.  They have become mere supplement catalogs with hackneyed exercise advice thrown in as filler. 

Whatever the supplement of the month may be — exotic protein powders, creatine, HMB, growth hormone, testosterone, bull semen, etc. — the idea is the same.  They are selling the idea that your exercise goals can be reached effortlessly if you invest in and consume enough of this stuff.

This can never be the case, for there is no effect without a cause and the most fundamental cause of radical physical improvement is hard work, performed consistently.  That’s right, it takes hard work to create the body of your dreams but I doubt that comes as a surprise to my dear, discerning reader.

Research periodicals publish work by academic exercise physiologists, a group whose bias is, in general, toward focusing on research devoted to so called “aerobic” exercise.  I’ll explain later why I place “aerobic” exercise in scare quotes. 

Those who populate our exercise physiology departments tend to favor endurance type activities and are generally suspicious of the benefits of resistance training and of the muscular jocks who espouse the virtues of this type of exercise.  The reasons why this is so involve a bit of historical serendipity that would take us a bit far afield here. 

One cause, however, is cultural. By this I mean the emphasis that our culture places on the internal qualities of a person. They say you cannot judge a book by its cover and to look for the good inside everyone.  Similarly, most voices in exercise physiology claim that what really counts is “good health” by which they mean good internal indicators of health, such as a healthy cholesterol level, a healthy blood pressure, a strong heart, etc.

While it is true that you can’t always judge a book by its cover, I submit that this is a false dichotomy, yet another variant of the popular dichotomy between mind and body.  There is no conflict between having strong shapely muscles and having a healthy cardiovascular system. In fact, having strong muscles is the best way to assure a healthy cardiovascular system.  I’ll come back to this point later.

Nor can you place too much confidence in the advice doled out by the big, muscular guys who strut around in your gym.  You have to be aware of the selection bias at work here. 

These individuals gravitate toward weight training because they experience immediate success with it.  It’s a positive feedback loop. The truth is, and this relates to the point I made about genetics at the outset, these guys would have grown large muscles even if you’d thrown tomatoes at them. 

Their training advice simply does not apply to the average trainee. Nor does the advice of most of these self-styled bodybuilding experts who have columns in the muscle magazines. 

 Most of these well-muscled jocks recommend an amount of training that could only be tolerated if you took steroids, which are synthetic hormones that radically improve your ability to recover from exercise,  and that is precisely why many of them experiment with such drugs. 

If you want to know how to change any important fitness parameter for the better—whether its strength, muscularity, leanness — its best to look at a methodology that works with people of average genetic endowment and whose efforts are not aided by pharmaceutical means.
