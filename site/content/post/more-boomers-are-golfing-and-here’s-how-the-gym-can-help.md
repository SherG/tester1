Some people go to the gym because they like to work out. But for many, it helps them keep doing something else they love. For more and more Baby Boomers, that includes golf.

According to the National Golf Foundation, the number of golfers over 65 rose to 4.2 million in 2018, up 17 percent from the previous year. That number should increase as more Boomers reach retirement age.

Players’ passion for the game is legendary.

> “I want to be able to play golf till the last day I’m breathing,” says Roy Sprague, 60, an architect in Houston who speaks for countless others. "That's my rest and relaxation. That's my stress release." 

When Roy found himself overweight, he joined a fitness studio to shed the pounds and to keep playing the game he loves. Now he’s proud that he’s in such good shape, his kids probably won’t need to care for him later.

Gym workouts help by building strength and flexibility, which are crucial to playing golf well.

Experts recommend exercises to stabilize muscles in his abdomen, back, hips and glutes – key for powerful swings and proper alignment. Being out of shape can limit your swing’s power and effectiveness.

And no golfer wants that to happen.
