## "Outstanding"

"Franciso Villalobos is an outstanding professional. As a personal trainer, he brings a true understanding of exercise physiology and health to his focused, responsible approach to [strength training](/services/). 

I am a physician and have been truly impressed, over the years, by Francisco’s careful attention to tailoring his training to the level and condition of each individual.

I trust him to train my ailing 83-year-old mother as well as my 8-year-old child, confident that Francisco will bring out the best possible effort from each, without ever overlooking medical issues.

For my own training, Francisco has gladly dealt with my limited schedule and interruptions, and has made me stronger and stronger each month and year. 

In addition to being a talented and dedicated professional, Francisco is a thoughtful, completely reliable, kind, and considerate person. 

I give him my highest possible recommendation."

## "excellent"

"Francisco’s understanding of the human body’s mechanics leads to excellent tailoring of a program suitable for each individual’s needs."

## "poise and class"

"I have been involved in personal training since 1983 as a trainer, manager, and educator, and Francisco is one of the few of the many that I’ve come across that I would have train me if I were the client.

I have no reservation about recommending him to anyone considering hiring a trainer. Few people, much less personal trainers, have the poise and class that Francisco has; along with the personal training skills. 

Please feel free to call me at my studio at [(609) 462-7722](<tel: 6094627722>) with any questions; but I recommend Francisco without hesitation."
