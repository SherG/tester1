description: 'Short or long strength training sessions: Which is better?'
---
As a fitness consultant, I’ve been thinking about and working in the fields of exercise and nutrition for over twenty years. 

People often ask me: 

* Is a 10- or 20-minute workout enough to stay in shape (or get in shape)?
* Is it better to exercise in short bursts? 
* How long should a beginner work out?
* Do I need to spend an hour in the gym for each session?

There are some popular -- yet false -- notions about what constitutes an effective training session and regimen. 

Let's take a closer look at these so you can understand what the science says. 

But first, let's consider the priority of setting aside _some time_ for exercise.

## Exercise is For Busy Baby Boomers, Like You

The most common excuse for not exercising is lack of time. 

It is an excuse with which I empathize. After all, it is by the “unforgiving minute” as Kipling put it, that we measure out our lives and the things we value. 

And those that instruct fitness can prove just as busy and riddled with excuses as those of other professions.

> Vitality is a cornerstone of a well-lived life.

We spend a good deal of time sleeping. This is a biological necessity. And we spend an awful lot of time working. That’s why it’s important to find a productive purpose, a career, which we love. Life is severely diminished if all we have to look forward to each week are its weekends.

Is it any wonder that in the sea of values we pursue, some values, such as exercise get drowned out?

### Make Time for What's Important

But we need to “make time” for what is important.

The best way to prioritize fitness is to _**schedule time for working out.**_



## Exercise Increases and Maintains your Vitality

There are at least two reasons why saying, “I don’t have the time” is an invalid excuse for not exercising. 

1. Proper exercise is essential to augmenting and maintaining our vitality. Because this vitality is a cornerstone of a _well-lived life_, exercise is one of the values we can scarcely ignore any more than good dental hygiene.
2. Second, if more people understood that all they need is one to three 30-minute sessions per week to obtain all of the health benefits associated with exercise, they wouldn’t use the "no time" excuse card. 

## Medical Science: Short Exercise Sessions Really Do Work

It sounds like quackery but one to three 30-minute sessions per week is the only time investment necessary to get the cardiovascular, muscular and bone strengthening benefits that the best exercise provides.

## High Intensity Training

McGuff promotes HIT -- or "High Intensity Training" -- a particular form of strength training that emphasizes slow movements. 

### Double Your Strength

In an interview with HITuni, a training resource, McGuff said: 

"Most people . . . within 12-20 weeks will expect to easily see their strength double and their body composition will improve markedly and it will seem almost -- compared to other approaches that they may have tried -- it will almost seem too easy to them."

He added, "The results are predictable and come about quickly" and that his clients are "just mindblown."

## Our Training

Here at Inner Strength Fitness (ISF), we also use the same HIT principles and approach discussed by Dr. McGuff. \
