description: Prioritizing our mobility keeps the door open to new adventures.

My wife and I recently visited Italy. It wasn't our first visit, but it was our first time together and we were committed to doing it right. 

We hired some tour guides for the ruins and museums of Rome, Florence, Pompeii and Venice. 

When we looked at some ruin or painting we wanted to be educated about what we were seeing. It was a wonderful trip!

But along with the many joys and delights I also experienced some sadness at seeing other couples our age or slightly older, having a difficult time keeping up with their tours. 

Many were burdened by their obesity. Others just had a tough time climbing stairs or even standing in lines because of a myriad of orthopedic concerns.

Isn’t it ironic that at the time in our lives that we finally have the disposable income and time to travel the world and enjoy its plentiful delights, that our bodies are often well on their way towards being a source of daily concern and disappointment?

The good news is that the last third of our lives can also be our best years. 

Surely, we need to remain open to learning, open to new experiences. But just as importantly we need to be committed to remaining as strong and functional as possible. 

Don’t spend your golden years on the sidelines. 

Develop the strength that will allow you to enjoy those years as the adventure they ought to be.
