The most common excuse given for not exercising is lack of time.  Worry not, dear reader!  A recent New York Times article provides hope to the time compressed.  

It referenced a study published in October in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise which indicates that even a small amount of weight training could reduce your risk of heart attack or stroke.  

Even better, these health benefits accrued regardless of whether the participants engaged in frequent aerobic exercise.  So whatâ€™s your excuse now?
