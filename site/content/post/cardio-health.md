That's good news because the most common excuse given for not exercising is lack of time.  

The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/well/move/even-a-little-weight-training-may-cut-the-risk-of-heart-attack-and-stroke.html" target="blank">Times article</a> noted the results of the large study:\
\
"The findings were dramatic: The risk of experiencing \[heart attack, stroke, or death] was roughly 50 percent lower for those who lifted weights occasionally, compared with those who never did — even when they were not doing the recommended endurance exercise. People who lifted twice a week, for about an hour or so in total, had the greatest declines in risk."

What about those who did weight training more than twice a week? "Interestingly, the subjects who reported weight training four or more times per week did not show any significant health benefits compared with those who never lifted, although the researchers believe this finding is probably a statistical anomaly."\

The article referenced a study published in October in the journal <a href="https://greysteel.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=45469f474a28b6a3c8167df48&id=311b2ae563&e=44cb3a58d3" target="blank">Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise</a>.

Even better, these health benefits accrued regardless of whether the participants engaged in frequent aerobic exercise.  So what’s your excuse now?
