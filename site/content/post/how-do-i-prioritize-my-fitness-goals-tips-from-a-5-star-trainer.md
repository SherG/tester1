One of the great things about being an exercise newbie however is that you can often achieve multiple goals at once.  

If you have never strength trained, for example, and you are carrying more fat then you prefer, you can often lose fat quite effectively while becoming stronger and more muscular.  An exercise newbies' body responds so enthusiastically to exercise that it will often do so even in the face of their caloric restriction.

But for those, like myself, that have done some form of exercise and watched what we eat for most of our lives, fitness goals must often be prioritized.  Exercise veterans who find themselves, again like myself, fluffier post holiday season then they wish to be, have to choose whether to make losing fat or becoming stronger/more muscular a priority.

It's not that an exercise veteran cannot become stronger while becoming leaner.  It's just that gains in strength, while on a caloric deficit sufficient to induce fat loss, will be slower and sometimes significantly so depending on the severity of your caloric deficit.  



There are tricks of the trade to balance these seemingly incompatible goals.  

You can make sure you are consuming adequate levels of protein.  

You can make sure you are eating as many calories as you can to not be depleted for your strength training workouts and yet enough to cause an acceptable rate of fat loss (half a pound to two pounds per week depending on the exerciser's starting weight). 

 You can play around with the intensity and volume of your strength training program so you can continue to make moderate progress despite the caloric deficit.

But in the final analysis, an exercise veteran has to acknowledge that facts are facts.  Strength and muscle are most efficiently built while on a moderate caloric surplus. 

 If you want to build up the structure which is your body, it makes sense to have an adequate number of bricks on hand for the purpose!  But if you want to give pride of place to becoming leaner for the time being, continue to work as hard as you can on building strength and maintaining your metabolically precious muscle.  

Just accept that becoming leaner, i.e., eating less then what your body needs to maintain its weight, will make getting stronger and especially building muscle exponentially more difficult.
