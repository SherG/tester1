One of the great things about being an exercise newbie however is that you can often achieve multiple goals at once.  

If you have never strength trained, for example, and you are carrying more fat then you prefer, you can often lose fat quite effectively while becoming stronger and more muscular.  An exercise newbies' body responds so enthusiastically to exercise that it will often do so even in the face of their caloric restriction.

But for those, like myself, that have done some form of exercise and watched what we eat for most of our lives, fitness goals must often be prioritized.  Exercise veterans who find themselves, again like myself, fluffier post holiday season then they wish to be, have to choose whether to make losing fat or becoming stronger/more muscular a priority.
