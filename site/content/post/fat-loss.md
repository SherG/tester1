But let's start with one foundational truth.

Fat loss is most crucially about controlling what and how much food you consume.

## Calorie Counting and Weight Loss

Despite the controversy that exists regarding low-carb and low fat diets, no one has found a way around the First Law of Thermodynamics. Until they do, you will have to consume less calories then you expend throughout the day if you are going to lose weight.

But this NYC strength coach is here to tell you that you don’t just want to lose weight, you want to lose fat. 

Many people are done a disservice by infomercials and fitness trends that advertise diet and exercise programs or supplements which will allegedly help you lose pounds overnight.

## Muscle Burns Fat 

If you want to lose fat, and that is the only kind of weight you should strive to lose if you are carrying more fat then is healthful, muscle is your friend.

The stronger and more developed your muscles are, the more fat your body will burn.

You can lose a significant percentage of your body fat in just 3 months and you will see visible results each month.

When you lose excess fat you will look better in your clothes and feel better and that is certainly important.

You should ask, “Pounds of what?” You don’t want to just lose water weight because you know you’ll eventually gain it right back. And you certainly don’t want to lose muscle.

## Lean Body, Vibrant Self

But the benefits of becoming lean are not just skin deep. If you feel good about yourself, you want your body image to reflect your self-image. 

Becoming lean allows your best, most vibrant self to have outward expression. 

Although a lean, strong body is not the cause of self-esteem, it contributes to and supports a healthy self-esteem. 

When it’s an expression of a healthy ego, and not just mere vanity, a lean, strong body expresses the vitality, discipline and integrity that resides within.

Have your body be the outward expression of your healthy self-love.
