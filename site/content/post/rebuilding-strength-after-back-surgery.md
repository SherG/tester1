  There are big health benefits to having a strong back. After my second surgery
  on my back, I did my first squat. I hope you'll find encouragement in my
  story.

During a martial arts accident, I herniated my disc at L5/S1. I underwent surgery for this on October 4.  I performed my first regular squat this past Wednesday.

Perhaps my back will never be the same.  Perhaps I will always face a greater risk of re-herniation.  But the only thing worse then a screwed up back is a screwed up back which is weak!
