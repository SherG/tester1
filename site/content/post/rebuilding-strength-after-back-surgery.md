  After surgery on my back, I recently did my first squat. I hope you'll find
  encouragement in my story.

During a martial arts accident, I herniated my disc at L5/S1. 

I underwent surgery for this on October 4.  I performed my first regular squat this past Wednesday.

Perhaps my back will never be the same.  

Perhaps I will always face a greater risk of re-herniation.  But the only thing worse then a screwed up back is a screwed up back which is weak!

## Health Benefits of a Strong Back

The best insurance against re-injury is a strong back. 

 And nothing builds the core muscles of your axial skeleton better then the basic barbell compound exercises: 

* Squat
* Deadlift
* Standing press.  

It will take a while to rebuild the strength I have lost, but I’m so grateful for my wife’s support and my surgeon’s expertise in allowing me to get back into the arena of life.

If you need help bouncing back from an injury please don’t hesitate to set up a [free phone appointment](https://calendly.com/isfny/15min/) with me.
