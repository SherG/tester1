  Baby boomers are stuck in the middle. As they enter their golden years,
  they're facing a dual care burden.
---
Their elderly parents require additional care and support, all while their adult children need a helping hand to start their independent lives.

In some cases, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/i-was-hoping-to-be-retired-the-cost-of-supporting-parents-and-adult-children-1542381023" target="blank">adult children are moving back home</a> as they deal with job loss or ongoing fallout from the Great Recession that began in 2008.

Many boomers themselves are still digging out from the impact of the recession and their own job, portfolio, or other losses.

## The Sandwich Generation: Stressed Out and Squeezed at Both Ends

Half of all Americans in their 60s are providing financial support to either a parent or an adult child, and 1.2 million boomers are supporting both, <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/01/30/the-sandwich-generation/" target="blank">according to Pew Research</a>. 

Such responsibilities are taking a toll, with boomers delaying retirement, experiencing significant stress, and facing a hit to their quality of life. 

## Managing Stress

It's important to find ways to manage your stress. 

An effective physical fitness program can be an important part of your stress-busting strategy.

When you build your physical strength, the process helps to release stress and improve your mood. 

### Boost Your Immune System

If stress is chronic and serious enough, it can have negative impact on your immune system. A good strength training program can significantly boost your immune system.

## Renew Your Vitality Through Strength Training

One of the greatest joys I’ve known is assisting countless baby boomers and members of the Silent Generation achieve a level of vitality, independence and buffer from injury that amazed them and me.

Again and again I’ve witnessed the qualitative difference that well-designed strength training has achieved in my clients.

One client came to me with a simple wish: could I help him get sufficiently strong so he could playfully toss his grandchildren in the pool?

Another client simply wanted to reach canned goods in her cupboards and carry groceries with a greater measure of confidence.

Still another simply wanted to be strong enough to continue smashing the ball in her tennis matches.

Whether you actively practice a sport or not, dealing intelligently with the advances of aging makes everyone over 50 a "Masters Athlete." 

My clientele are composed exclusively of such athletes and I regard the fact that I’ve improved the quality of each of their lives as one of my crowning achievements as a strength coach.

If you find yourself struggling with the groceries, stairs, stowing carry-on in an overhead compartment or would just like to see yourself playing a sport or attacking each day with greater vigor, <a href="https://calendly.com/isfny/15min" target="blank">book a phone appointment</a> with me.

I look forward to discussing your goals and the Inner Strength Fitness program with you.
