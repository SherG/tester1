## Our Mission

Educate and motivate each client to fulfill the ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body through the application of the latest in the sciences of exercise physiology, nutrition, positive psychology and philosophic practice.

## Our Core Principles

* The purpose of exercise is to make you stronger and leaner so that your body expresses and supports your joy in living.
* The purpose of nutrition is to nourish the body with a variety of nutrient-dense food so that your entire day can be infused with vitality.
* The essence of self-motivation is a commitment to constant and never ending growth grounded in self-acceptance. 

## An Intelligent Choice

If you want or expect more from your fitness trainer than a chiseled physique then give Inner Strength Fitness a try.

Our personal trainers are experts in:

* Analyzing movement
* Designing personalized workouts
* Optimizing your exercise plan. 

They are also excellent communicators and superb motivators and bring the Inner Strength philosophy in to every client session.
