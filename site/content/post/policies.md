  What happens during your initial consultation at Inner Strength Fitness? And
  what policies can you expect?
---
## Initial Consultation

During your initial consultation, we will discuss your goals, any medical issues that may exist and your exercise history.

You'll learn about our policies and procedures, the fundamental nature and features of the Inner Strength Fitness Program and how they will be individualized to your specific needs.

We will devote the rest of your consultation to an introductory education on how to perform a few basic weight training exercises. This is to provide the proper instructional foundation for your future fitness success.

## Choose From Three Private Gyms . . .  Or Your Home

Inner Strength Program clients are free to select from two midtown Manhattan studio locations, or our FiDI location. Clients may also choose to be trained at their personal home or building gym.

Our private studios are at:

* 532 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10022
* 20 Pine Street, New York, NY 10005

## How much does personal fitness training cost?

The price per session varies from $90 to $110, depending on how many sessions you purchase in advance or how often you train.

These rates are very reasonable for the NYC area, especially considering that you don’t have the added expense of gym fees. You pay for our coaching only.

## General service policies

* Sessions are by appointment only.
* To assure adequate scheduling times a 24-hour cancellation policy is necessary. Cancellations with less than 24 hours notice will be billed for that visit.
* Please arrive on time, ready to train and with proper attire in order to get the full benefits of your session

## Refunds

Refunds are available, less any sessions used and a $250 cancellation fee within 72 hours of your purchase, to all clients who relocate more than five miles from any of our locations, or with a doctor’s note stating that they can no longer train. 

Otherwise and for all other cases, once the fee for our services has been accepted, no refunds are possible.
