  New study sheds light on how lab tests affect patient's perceptions and their
  actions.

Given the current popularity and ubiquity of tests like those provided by companies like [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/) I thought it worthwhile to share the results of this scientific study.

Learning oneâ€™s genetic risk changes physiology, _independent of actual genetic risk_, according to a new study in [_Nature Human Behaviour_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0483-4%22%20%5Cl%20%22auth-1).

> People who obtain genetic test results behave differently and experience different outcomes.

In the same way that more expensive, high-tech interventions (like surgery) often provide greater placebo effects in the context of treating pain, it appears that high-tech tools (like genetic testing) can similarly provide large placebo and nocebo effects as well. 

## Clinical Testing as a Science

And given that clinical testing is an imperfect science with risk for false positives and false negatives, individuals should be very careful in pushing for, or ordering for themselves, tests which may not be clinically necessary in order to guide treatment decisions.

Neuroscientist Erman Misirlisoy explores "how people behave once they gain knowledge about their genetic predispositions."  

The author cites the same study referenced in this article. 

He notes: "Positive expectations can shift us into a productive mindset, and negative expectations can make us pessimistic about our health, fitness, and self-control."
