Given the current popularity and ubiquity of tests like those provided by companies like 23 and me I thought it worthwhile to share another scientific paper review.

Learning one’s genetic risk changes physiology independent of actual genetic risk, Bradley P. Turnwald, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0483-4%22%20%5Cl%20%22auth-1" target="blank">_Nature Human Behaviour_</a>, volume 3, pages48–56 (2019)

In the same way that more expensive, high-tech interventions (like surgery) often provide greater placebo effects in the context of treating pain, it appears that high-tech tools (like genetic testing) can similarly provide large placebo and nocebo effects as well. And given that clinical testing is an imperfect science with risk for false positives and false negatives, individuals should be very careful in pushing for, or ordering for themselves, tests which may not be clinically necessary in order to guide treatment decisions.
