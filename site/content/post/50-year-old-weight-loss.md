description: Sharing my goals and progress with others to fuel my resolve

There are times we can and should loosen the reigns and enjoy the many delights life has to offer—special family gatherings, holiday get-togethers, vacations.  But the cumulative effect of these celebrations can often leave us looking fluffier then we want to be.

But these occasional periods of indulgence need not define who we are or determine the long term shape of our bodies.  We always have the power to return to the discipline of healthful daily routines.  These include regular strength training and a calorically moderate, well varied diet.

In the aftermath of my recent back operation and the holiday season I find myself pushing into my belt line more then feels comfortable.  This morning I got back to my normal routine of using My Fitness Pal to keep track of my calories and macros.  Consistent with my previous post, I didn’t wait till Monday.  I started acting on my fitness goal the day after getting home from vacation.

The only difference is that this time around I will be taking my striving public and sharing my journey to rediscover the leaner, more sculpted self that lies under my currently softer exterior.  I hope my public striving will inspire my dear readers in their fitness goals and serve as a reminder that we always remain the masters of our fate.  



And perhaps it may inspire my dear readers to similarly take their striving public.  There is no tribunal as important as our own judgement of ourselves.  But striving in public does feel like it carries a weightier level of accountability.  Try it with whatever kind of goal you are thinking of pursuing.  It may add fuel to your resolve to succeed!
