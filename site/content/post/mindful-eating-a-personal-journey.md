description: This is my story of how I grew out of a rule-bound approach to eating.

In her essay “Philosophical Detection” Ayn Rand writes:

"_To take ideas seriously means that you intend to live by, to practice, an idea that you accept as true. Philosophy provides man with a comprehensive view of life. In order to evaluate it properly, ask yourself what a given theory, if accepted, would do to a human life, stating with your own_."

That passage has inspired me to share some personal stories about my relationship with food.  I once accepted certain rules about eating, rules that had nothing to do with a healthy relationship with food.  These rules kept me from enjoying food fully, genuinely and in a way that was consistent with my other values.

## Growing Up in the Dominican Republic

My mother is from the Dominican Republic. When I was little she and I would travel back to her hometown regularly.  

On one of these trips, my family and I were driving back from the beach. I was enjoying a meal I had put off eating earlier.

Corruption is rife in developing countries like the Dominican Republic and it was not uncommon back then to have one’s car stopped by a police officer looking for a bribe.  On this particular day that is precisely what happened.

### Saving the Best for Last

We were driving along our merry way when we were flagged over by a police officer standing by the side of the road.  \
\
He approached the car and started to chit chat with my aunt and at that point every adult in the car knew what the subtext was—give me some money or I’ll make getting back home difficult.  

I remember my aunt apologizing to him about not having any money and asking him if he would accept some food as a sign of our respect. \
\
This is when my ears perked up. The adults in the car started looking around to see if there was any left over food we could give the officer and then all eyes stopped on my plate.

### Savoring a Traditional Meal

As was my habit back then, I had divided my plate into little compartments.  Rice and beans in one section, well-seasoned roasted pork in another section, sweet plantains in another. I liked all the foods on this particular plate.  

The point of this separation wasn’t to pick out foods I refused to eat but to enjoy the foods in a particular order — from least to most favorite. 

By the time we were stopped, I had enjoyed the pork and plantains and was really looking forward to my absolute favorite — the rice and beans.  

### Good Things Come to Those Who Wait?

Perhaps it had been my Mom telling me countless times that good things come to those who wait.  

Perhaps it was the pride I took personally in being able to delay gratification.

> My aunt grabbed my plate of food and gave it to the police officer. 

I may never know exactly where and how I had absorbed the belief that you ought to save the best for last but that day I was about to discover the unintended consequences of holding on to that belief.

Reading the situation, I tried to lift the plate close to my face and started to lift a forkful of rice and beans to my mouth. But my aunt grabbed the plate from my hands and handed it to the police officer.  

I protested in vain as my aunt pulled away from the side of the road in the hope that the officer would not protest the paltriness of the offering.

## Mindful Eating: A Lesson in Enjoying Food

So what philosophic lesson did I draw from this?  Well, for one, that police corruption sucks! 

But more to the point, I learned that I shouldn’t approach eating with artificial rules.  I should eat what I enjoy in a meal and enjoyment should be my focus from the start of the meal to the end.  

> I learned that I shouldn’t approach eating with artificial rules.

But if that had been the only lesson I had ever learned about eating I would have developed into a hedonist and that would have been good neither for my waistline or long term health.  

Eating, one of life’s greatest delights, ought to be enjoyed fully.  But eating, even when enjoyed with another of life’s great delights — great conversation — is not the only thing that makes life worthwhile.
