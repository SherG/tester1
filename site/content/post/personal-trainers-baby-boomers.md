Journal reporter <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/forget-the-hotshot-trainer-with-the-six-pack-boomers-want-mature-fitness-coaches-11554557400" target="blank">Hilary Potkowitz's article</a> is a must-read for baby boomers looking to get the best return on their fitness investment. 

She writes "As older people hit the gym in record numbers, demand rises for trainers in their 50s and 60s."

And she recounts the experience of many boomers. For example, Lynne Ranieri's criteria for a personal trainer included this insight: "I did not want a perky, 20-something in Spandex telling this 60-something year-old body to do things it shouldn’t—or couldn’t—be doing."

My wife and a dear friend recently called my attention to this article. It's heartening news for boomer trainers like myself who focus on making other boomers and seniors the strongest versions of themselves.
